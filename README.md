Fitness App

The application is designed to provide a solution for gyms and make the work of the coach to be simpler, faster and yet create a connection between the trainer and the trainee.

The gym earns more by the close connection between trainer and trainee so there will be more weight on the trainer and more supervision that will cause the trainee to take personal training. Moreover , the gym will have the tools to perform statistical analyzes to examine , for example , how much training programs were written per day and  on which level the trainer was active and etc.

The first stage is to build the app-

There are several application interfaces:

1.	Interface trainer - the trainer is responsible for writing programs as well as, answering on the questions that are asked on the application by the trainee . In addition, each trainer will be responsible for writing daily tips that the trainees will get the tips in the app.
Registration trainer phases - opening a new user name, by fill email and phone number. Coach plays the personal details of the trainee: First and Last Name, Phone, Email, choosing from a list there gym. Then the trainee receives email with a password so he could enter the app. 
In the second stage, the trainer fills with the trainee his personal information. Male / Female , Age , Height , Weight and Measures scale to weigh fat percentage .
After filling out personal information, there will be button of building a new program . The trainer begins to build the program by choosing exercises from the database . The database will include exercises for use with instruments gym as well as exercises with free weights.


•	Database - The database will contain pictures of the devices in the gym as well as exercises with free weights. The pictures will include brief explanation of how to perform the exercises. If the user is female, the pictures will be of a woman, and when male there will be images of man .

After filling out the training program, the trainer will recommend the number of training sessions per week and it will automatically appear in the program.
The trainer's app will receive questions from the trainees and be able to see all the training programs he wrote.
Each trainer will have permission to modify the plan as needed.
Every trainer in turn will write tip / daily recommendation for all trainees use the app in the gym where he works.

Visually – the trainer enters the application , after signing up , there be a tab when the title will be "the people I train" - this tab will show all the trainees he wrote them training programs together with an image for each trainee , when he presses the trainee image he gets the program he wrote , his achievements etc. Another tab will be "my tips", there will be the possibility to write a tip and see the tips he wrote. Another tab will be able to see the trainers achievements, how much training programs he wrote, and trainees will be able to rate the trainer so the trainer can see how it is graded and where he stands among the other trainers.

 
2.	 Interface trainee - trainee registered the application by receiving the password after the trainer filled his personal details.
At the beginning will appear the trainee's training program and will have the option to check what exercise is performed as well as he could by a stopwatch to know how long it takes an average workout. Every 3 months Pops up a reminder to change the training program.
The trainee will be able to see all the tips of the trainers on a daily basis and will have access to send messages to the trainer in the application.
The trainee will be able upload a picture of him exercising and to see the pictures of the group listed in the same gym. The trainee will be able to invite a friend for a workout through the application by sending a summons to practice at specific time. There will be lifter option to close this option if someone won't be interested summoned him for training.

Visually - trainee enters an application after he registered, the first tab he could see his training program, each stage will marked by emoji of muscular hand after finishing the exercise. At the end of each workout the trainee will be able to see how long he practiced, which exercises done and finished. Also, it will schedule patterned calendar when he practiced and its achievements in terms of training, whether improved (weights, repetitions.) If the trainee is not going to keep up with the training, for example his goal is to train three times a week, the system will recognize it and give him a warning that he should make another 2 training. The application also, will alert every three months to change the training program. In separate tab will be a list of trainees  in the gym listed in the application and it will be possible for a member to send invitation for a practice as to another member. The third tab, will be the tips of trainers. There will be the option to send message to the trainer, which the trainee can ask about the program or to receive any tip.

The gym side - the gym will get from the administrator's application statistics, such as how a trainer graduated, how many training programs he wrote and how many of this are personal training.
My idea for the gyms is to purchase a tablet that will be used each time by another trainer and will be responsible for answering questions by online trainees.

At the initial stage, the app will be be launched for free  and the goal is to gain as many users, which leads the next step to raise investors to develop the application.


Phase II - the establishment of a social network entirely on fitness and nutrition.
